## 📚 About

This game was created while following a Unity beginner tutorial as part of my learning journey.  
It helped me understand:
- Unity basics (scenes, game objects, components)
- Scripting in C#
- Collision, input, and scoring systems
- Building and packaging a game

Although the core mechanics are tutorial-based, it marks my first complete game project and the beginning of my path into game development.
